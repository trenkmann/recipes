# Sourdough

# Lactic Bateria

Produces Lactic Acid and Acetic Acid

## Lactic Acid

tastes: 
- less acidic,
- yoghurt,

likes:
- wet 
- warm

## Acietic Acid

tastes: 
- more acidic,
- vinegar,

# Hypothesis: 

## More Sourness, More Vinegar

- dry, cool dough to increase Acetic Acid
- whole grain  to increase Acetic Acid
- Oxygen to make alcohol into acid
- less refreshing to increase acid and alcohol levels

## Less Sourness, More Yoghurt

- wet, warm dough to increase Lactic Acid
- white bread flour to increase Lactic Acid
- less Oxygen to decrease Alcohol to Acid reactions
- more refreshing, throw away more Starter to get rid of Alcohol/Aldehydes/Ketones and Acid

## More Sourness, More Yoghurt

- wet, warm dough to increase Lactic Acid
- white bread flour to increase Lactic Acid
- less refreshing to increase Alcohol/Acid
- more Oxygen to increase Alcohol to Acid reactions
