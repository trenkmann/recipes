# Pickles

## General Tipps

- Use dedicated pickling Cucumbers
- 2.5% Salt
- 2.5% Sugar

## Experiments

- :heavy_check_mark: **Szechuan and Chili flakes:** Very Tasty
- :x: **Szechuan and Chipotle:** The smokey Flavour is not great
- :x: **Szechuan and dried Chili:** Less smokey but still not great
- :heavy_check_mark: **Lemon and "krumme Gurke"**, I think I used twice as much sugar as salt + Lemon juice instead of half the vinegar 

## Lecucu - Lemon Cucumber

- 1/2 Water (a bit more to reduce acidity)
- 1/4 vinegar
- 1/4 Lemon Juice
- Curly Cucumbers or other small firm variaties
- 2% salt
- 4% sugar

Amazing, let sit for at least a week before digging in.
